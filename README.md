Icinga Web Generic TTS Integration
===============

Icinga Web Generic TTS Integration implements Icinga Web's ticket hook for replacing ticket patterns
with links to your trouble ticket system (TTS).
Icinga Web 2's core module `monitoring` for example uses the ticket hook for
acknowledgements, downtimes and comments.
Other modules may use the ticket hook for all kinds of text too.
